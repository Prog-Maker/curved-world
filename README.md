# curved-world
Recreation of the world curvature effect from Animal Crossing and many endless runners. Made in Unity with shader graph. To view [shader here](CurevedWorld/Assets/CurveWorld.shadergraph) you need to open it in Unity, because its made in an engine tool and the file is not intended to be human readable. There is a [camera controller](CurevedWorld/Assets/CameraController.cs) as well which controllers the tilt of the shader while it moves the camera.
